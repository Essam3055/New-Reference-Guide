 Release 4.5
Release 4.5.16
Fix: reading aggregate events searches for older events when the last event sequence number is the same as the snapshot sequence number
New property for index, axoniq.axonserver.event.segments-for-sequence-number-check, defines the number of segments that Axon Server will check for events on an aggregate when an event with sequence number 0 is stored. The default value for this property is 10. For performance reasons, if you increase this property to a value higher than 100 it is recommended to also increase the axoniq.axonserver.event.max-bloom-filters-in-memory property.

## Release 4.5

### Release 4.5.21
Fix for bloom filter index: reading aggregate events searches for older events when the last event sequence number is the same as the snapshot sequence number
New property for bloom filter index, axoniq.axonserver.event.segments-for-sequence-number-check, defines the number of segments that Axon Server will check for events on an aggregate when an event with sequence number 0 is stored. The default value for this property is 10. For performance reasons, if you increase this property to a value higher than 100 it is recommended to also increase the axoniq.axonserver.event.max-bloom-filters-in-memory property.

Fix for contexts not starting when some contexts are using BLOOM_FILTER_INDEX and others are using JUMP_SKIP_INDEX.
Release 4.5.4
Fix: Clients should not connect to a node that is unable to contact other nodes in the cluster If a client requests a connection from an isolated Axon Server node, Axon Server rejects the connection, and the client requests a connection from another node. If a client has a connection to an Axon Server node, and the node loses the connection to the other Axon Server nodes in the cluster, Axon Server will disconnect the client. The client reconnects to another node (also in 4.4.16).
Fix: Regression in loading aggregate events performance
Fix: Handle queries with same request type but different response type
Fix: client sometimes reconnects when other Axon Server node is restarted

local.aggregate.segments: monitors the number of segments that were accessed for reading aggregate event requests
Notes:
Default value for configuration property axoniq.axonserver.event.events-per-segment-prefetch is decreased from 50 to 10.
Release 4.5.3
Improved performance for reading aggregates
Axon Server is now reading events for an aggregate from multiple event store segments in parallel. The order in which Axon Server returns the events remains unchanged.
Reduced memory usage for in-memory indexes
Axon Server maintains index entries for the latest event store segment in-memory. The structure of this data has been changed to reduce the heap used by this index.
Reduced number of files kept open as memory-mapped files
Axon Server now only keeps a (configurable) number of event files open as memory-mapped files. Older files will be opened and closed when needed. The number of event store segments that are opened as memory mapped files can be configured through the property: axoniq.axonserver.event.memory-mapped-segments
Initialize event stores asynchronously on startup
When Axon Server needs to recreate indexes for a context on startup, it can take some time to complete. This change makes the initialization of the context asynchronous, so that if one context takes a long time to initialize, other replication groups are already available. This also makes the HTTP endpoint available sooner, so liveliness checks succeed faster.

Release 4.4.16
Fix: Clients should not connect to a node that is unable to contact other nodes in the cluster If a client requests a connection from an isolated Axon Server node, Axon Server rejects the connection, and the client requests a connection from another node. If a client has a connection to an Axon Server node, and the node loses the connection to the other Axon Server nodes in the cluster, Axon Server will disconnect the client. The client reconnects to another node.
